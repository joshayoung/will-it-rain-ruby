## Weather Program to Send Forecast Data
This repo pulls in the current weather forecast for the week. The email functionality allows you to send the weather data to someone on a periodic basis.

## To Do
 * Add email script that calls the Mail class.
 * Account for difference between the time the api is called.
 * Change object to respond to methods for each day (e.g. obj.monday, obj.tuesday, etc).
