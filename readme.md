## Weather Program to Send Forecast Data
This repo pulls in the current weather forecast for the week. The email functionality allows you to send the weather data to someone on a periodic basis.

## To see testing coverage report:
 * Start a server at the root of the project (python's SimpleHTTPServer works for this)
 * Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/coverage` in your browser

## To Do
 * Account for difference between the time the api is called.
 * Create a separate class for API calls and move out of weather class.
